This project was created with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and some native [Widgets](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets-intro) like SingleChildScrollView, Hero Animation, SliverAppBar, StreamBuilder and of course I used things such as Delegate, Provider, Services, etc.

<h4> List of dependencies: </h4>

- flutter v2.13.1
- [card_swiper](https://pub.dev/packages/card_swiper) - (to make transitions between elements)
- [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) - (to make HTTP requests with Future functionality)
- [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) - (To make easier and more reusable widgets for manage state)
